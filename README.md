# Oracle Linux Automation Manager

Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Oracle Linux Automation Engine are the latest additions to the Oracle Linux operating environment.
Together, these new capabilities provide a cost effective, powerful, web-based automation engine with reporting, credentialed role-based access control, work flow automation, and job scheduling framework for Oracle Linux customers that need modern provisioning, deployment, configuration management, and task automation.
Oracle Linux Automation Manager and Engine, based upon the open source AWX and Ansible projects, respectively, are included with an Oracle Linux Premier Support subscription. Oracle Linux Premier Support customers already using or evaluating AWX or Ansible can run these technologies fully supported, at no additional cost, on Oracle Linux.

This repository will contain example ansible playbook code.
